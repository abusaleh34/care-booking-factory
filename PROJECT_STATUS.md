## üèÜ Key Milestones Achieved & Core Functionality Delivered

*   **End-to-End Booking MVP:** Customers can search for providers, view services, and complete a booking (mock payment). Providers can manage their services and view their schedule.
*   **Robust Foundation:** Project successfully initialized with a modern tech stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).
*   **Functional Authentication:** User registration and login (JWT-based conceptual flow with MSW) are working. `AuthContext` manages user state.
*   **Full Internationalization (i18n):** Seamless English and Arabic language support with LTR/RTL layouts across the application.
*   **Comprehensive API Mocking:** Mock Service Worker (MSW) effectively mocks all backend APIs, enabling independent frontend development and testing.
*   **Component-Based UI:** Extensive use of shadcn/ui components for a consistent and modern look and feel.
*   **Provider Service Management:** Providers have full CRUD capabilities for their service offerings.
*   **Provider Calendar View:** Providers can visually track their appointments on a monthly calendar.
*   **Responsive Design Core:** Implemented pages are designed to be responsive across common device sizes.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** `README.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and `SETUP_GUIDE.md` are up-to-date.

## üéØ Next Steps

1.  **Refine and Test Existing Features:**
    *   Thoroughly test the booking flow, service management, and calendar across different scenarios and user roles.
    *   Address any bugs or UI inconsistencies.
2.  **Complete "My Bookings" Pages:**
    *   Develop UI for customers to view their past and upcoming bookings.
    *   Allow for booking modifications or cancellations (if part of scope).
3.  **Implement Full Provider Profile Management:**
    *   Create UI for providers to fully edit their profile details (bio, images, working hours, address, etc.).
4.  **Develop Customer Profile & Settings Page:**
    *   Allow customers to update their profile information, password, and language preferences.
5.  **UX/UI Polish and Accessibility Audit:**
    *   Conduct a full pass on responsiveness for all implemented pages.
    *   Implement all necessary empty states and refine loading indicators.
    *   Perform a WCAG accessibility audit and implement improvements.
6.  **Real Backend Integration Planning:**
    *   Define actual API schemas and plan for replacing MSW with a live backend.
    *   Implement real JWT handling with secure cookie-based refresh tokens on the backend.
7.  **Testing Strategy Implementation:**
    *   Begin writing unit tests for critical components and utility functions (e.g., Vitest/Jest + RTL).
    *   Plan for end-to-end tests for key user flows (e.g., Playwright/Cypress).
8.  **Optional Enhancements (Phase 6):**
    *   Begin implementation of features like wishlists, notifications, or map integration as per priority.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Blockers / Risks (To be monitored)

*   **Real Backend Complexity:** Transitioning from MSW to a live backend with real database interactions and business logic will be a significant effort.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrating a real payment gateway will require careful setup and security considerations.
*   **Scalability of Calendar/Availability:** Ensuring the calendar and availability logic performs well with many providers and bookings.
*   **Time for Full UX/Accessibility Polish:** Achieving a high level of polish and full WCAG compliance can be time-consuming.
