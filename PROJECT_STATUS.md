# BeautyBook - Project Status

**Date:** June 6, 2025

## üöÄ Overview

This document outlines the current status of the BeautyBook project, a web-based booking platform for beauty and wellness services. The project aims to deliver a modular, scalable, and bilingual (Arabic/English) application focusing on Customer and Service Provider panels.

## üìä Current Status

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Completed**
*   **Details:**
    *   Next.js 14 project initialized with TypeScript.
    *   Tailwind CSS v3 and shadcn/ui integrated for styling and UI components.
    *   Internationalization (i18n) setup with `i18next` for English and Arabic, including LTR/RTL support.
    *   Next.js App Router configured for routing.
    *   Standardized folder structure (`/components`, `/app`, `/hooks`, `/contexts`, `/services`, `/assets`, `/i18n`, `/lib`, `/mocks`) established.
    *   Mock Service Worker (MSW) configured for API mocking.
    *   Base layout and providers (`QueryClientProvider`, `I18nextProvider`, `ThemeProvider`) set up.

### Phase 2: User Authentication
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Completed**
*   **Details:**
    *   Login and Registration pages (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`) implemented with form validation (Zod + React Hook Form).
    *   Authentication layout (`app/(auth)/layout.tsx`) with language switcher.
    *   Mock API endpoints for login and registration via MSW.
    *   `AuthContext` (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) created to manage user state and tokens (though full private route HOC is conceptual).
    *   Placeholders for social logins (Google/Apple) included in UI.
    *   OTP verification flow is conceptualized (MSW endpoint exists), UI page pending.

### Phase 3: Customer Portal Features
*   **Status:** üü° **In Progress**
*   **Completed:**
    *   Home Page (`app/page.tsx`): Includes hero section, search bar, and featured categories.
    *   Service Search Page (`app/(customer)/search/page.tsx`): Implemented with filters (category, rating, featured), search query input, and pagination. Displays provider cards.
    *   Service Provider Profile Page (`app/providers/[id]/page.tsx`): Dynamically displays provider details, services, gallery, working hours, and reviews.
*   **In Progress / Planned:**
    *   **Booking Flow UI:** Date/time picker, confirmation screen, and mock checkout process.
    *   **View Bookings:** Pages for customers to view past and upcoming bookings.
    *   **Rate and Review System:** UI for submitting and editing reviews (display is partially done on provider profile).

### Phase 4: Service Provider Portal
*   **Status:** üü° **In Progress**
*   **Completed:**
    *   Provider Dashboard (`app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`): Basic layout showing stats (total bookings, upcoming, revenue, rating), today's appointments, quick actions, and recent bookings table.
*   **In Progress / Planned:**
    *   **Profile Setup/Management:** UI for providers to set up and edit their profile (bio, images, working hours).
    *   **Service List Management:** CRUD operations for services (add, edit, delete) with mock API integration.
    *   **Booking Schedule View:** Calendar interface for providers to view and manage their bookings.
    *   **Chat Interface (Mocked):** Basic UI for provider-customer communication.
    *   **Earnings Summary Page:** Detailed view of earnings and statistics.

### Phase 5: UX Enhancements & Responsive Design
*   **Status:** üü° **In Progress**
*   **Completed:**
    *   Basic responsiveness achieved through Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
    *   Loading skeletons implemented on Provider Dashboard and Profile pages.
    *   Basic LTR/RTL text direction and font handling for Arabic/English.
    *   CSS animations for transitions (`tailwindcss-animate`).
*   **In Progress / Planned:**
    *   **Comprehensive Responsiveness:** Thorough testing and optimization for mobile, tablet, and desktop views across all pages.
    *   **Empty States:** Design and implement user-friendly empty states for lists, search results, etc.
    *   **Accessibility Audit:** Validate color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and overall WCAG compliance.

### Phase 6: Optional Enhancements
*   **Status:** ‚ö™ **Planned**
*   **Details:**
    *   Wishlist/favorites feature for customers.
    *   Notification bell with mock messages.
    *   Settings page (language, password, preferences).
    *   Mock integration with a maps API for provider geolocation visualization.

## üéØ Next Steps

1.  **Complete Customer Booking Flow:**
    *   Implement date and time selection components.
    *   Develop the booking confirmation and mock checkout UI.
    *   Integrate with MSW for booking creation.
2.  **Develop Service Provider Service Management:**
    *   Create UI for CRUD operations on services.
    *   Integrate with MSW endpoints for service management.
3.  **Implement Calendar View for Providers:**
    *   Choose and integrate a calendar component (e.g., from shadcn/ui or a dedicated library).
    *   Display provider bookings on the calendar.
4.  **Build Remaining Portal Pages:**
    *   Customer: My Bookings, My Favorites, Profile/Settings.
    *   Provider: Profile Setup/Edit, Earnings Details.
5.  **Enhance UX and Responsiveness:**
    *   Conduct thorough testing on various devices.
    *   Implement missing empty states and refine loading states.
    *   Begin accessibility audit and improvements.
6.  **Implement Full Private Route Logic:**
    *   Develop a robust HOC or middleware for protecting routes based on authentication status and user role using `AuthContext`.
7.  **GitHub Repository Setup:**
    *   Create a remote repository on GitHub.
    *   Push the existing codebase.
    *   Establish branching strategy (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches).

## üèÜ Key Milestones Achieved

*   Project successfully initialized with a modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).
*   Core authentication flow (Login, Register) is functional with mock APIs.
*   Internationalization (i18n) for English and Arabic is in place with LTR/RTL support.
*   Foundation for both Customer and Service Provider portals laid out (Home, Search, Provider Profile, Provider Dashboard).
*   Mock Service Worker (MSW) is effectively mocking backend APIs, allowing for independent frontend development.
*   Comprehensive `README.md` created.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Blockers / Risks (To be monitored)

*   **Complexity of Booking Logic:** Ensuring accurate availability and conflict-free booking across multiple providers/services.
*   **State Management for Complex Flows:** Deciding on the extent of Zustand or other global state managers beyond React Query and Context for more intricate UI states.
*   **Time for Full Responsiveness and Accessibility:** These can be time-consuming to implement thoroughly across all components and pages.
